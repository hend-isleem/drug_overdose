## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed the following tools:
- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hend-isleem/drug_overdose.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd prohealth
   ```

3. **Install the project dependencies:**

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server.

Using npm:
```bash
npm start
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the React development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

The optimized static files will be generated in the `build` directory.

### Running Tests

Using npm:
```bash
npm test
```

Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn test
```

## Environment Variables

```

### Useful Scripts
